      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Answers are case <b>in</b>sensitive! e.g. "Elite Hacker" == "eLite haCKer"</li>
        <li>Leading and trailing whitespace in your answer is stripped away.</li>
        <li>We strive to make the answers be short, concise, and easy to enter. If you find youself entering very log answers with complex spacing and punctuation, you are probably <b>not</b> on the right track.</li>
        <li>Some questions contain free hints about the formatting of the answer. Use them!</li>
