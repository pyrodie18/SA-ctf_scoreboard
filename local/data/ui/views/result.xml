        <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A full description of scoring is available on the <a href="rules">rules page</a>
          </li>
          <li>If you answer a question correctly (and between the start and end times for that question), your team will be awarded full base points. </li>
          <li>Correct answers also earn a speed bonus which is larger for earlier entries, and smaller for later entries. Speed counts! </li>
          <li>If your result is correct, but you were not awarded base or bonus points, you likely submitted your answer before or after the question was 
              active. This is usually not something you need to worry about as the organizers will have set the times appropriately for the competition. </li>
          <li>You may answer a question correctly more than once, but it won't do you any good. Multiple correct 
              submissions do not result in a penalty, but we only count one correct submission (the one that resulted in 
              the most points) per question. Regardless of what you think you see above, <b> It does not 
              pay to resubmit correct answers for the same question multiple times. </b>
          </li>
          <li>An educated guess is not a bad thing. On the other hand, we can't have you brute-forcing our answer system. Incorrect answers
              result in a penalty. Penalties are cumulative, so after a certain number of incorrect responses you will have exhausted the 
              base and bonus points available for that question. </li>
          <li>If you are working as a team, you need <b>not</b> submit answers from multiple users. In fact there is no benefit to doing so. 
              Be careful with incorrect attempts though, as a penalty against one team member is a penalty against all. We recommend 
              staying in close contact with your team during the competition. </li>
